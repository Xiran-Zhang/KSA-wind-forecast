Calculating the 53333 by 3173 cross-correlation matrix.

NOTE: this step can be take a few minutes.

The optimal values of ESN parameters:

                         input lag,      m = 1
        number of reservoir states,    n_h = 2500
                     ridge penalty, lambda = 0.15
    scaling matrix parameter for W,  delta = 0.9
                      leaking rate,    phi = 1.0
         magnitude of entries in W,    a_w = 0.05
         magnitude of entries in U,    a_u = 0.01
                     sparsity of W,   pi_w = 0.1
                     sparsity of U,   pi_u = 0.01
The total number of hours (2013-2016) considered: 35040
Part of Table 3 for the MSE for y_t^* at all 3,173 knots and time points in 2016 by the ESN and persistence methods. Note that the ESN is a stochastic approach, so the MSE may be slightly different than the values reported in the paper.

The annual sum of the absolute differences in wind energy during 2016 at all the 75 wind turbines is
      2.77E+08kW·h for S-ESN,
      3.05E+08kW·h for ARIMA,
  and 3.12E+08kW·h for persistence.
Thus, we obtain a 9% improvement against the ARIMA forecasts and an 11% improvement against the persistence forecasts.
